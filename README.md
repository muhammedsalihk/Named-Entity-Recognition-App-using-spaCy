# Named-Entity-Recognition-App-using-spaCy

## Introduction
Named entity recognition is an information extraction task where named entities like person names, organisation names, locations etc. are extracted from unstructured text. In this project, we build a simple interative app for entity extraction using spacy, streamlit and sumy (a text summariser package).

## Implementation
The webapp has been built using streamlit and can be run using the command 
```
streamlit run myapp.py
```
